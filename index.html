    <p>The Front Range is probably Colorado's best known mountain range. The altitudes of included peaks, mountains and points have a staggering range from 5,200ft. up to 14,278ft (9,000'+ departure!). The geology and vegetation because of such a varience in altitude is overwhelmingly diverse. Animal life likewise, is just as myriad. On the steep, talus covered slopes of the alpine, one would see bighorn sheep, pika (coneys) and marmots. Lower down in the coniferous forests: bear, elk, deer, pine marten, ferns and even orchids call the sheltering trees home.
    </p>
    <p>The Front Range is often referred to as the 'Urban Corridor' because of it being a prominent western boundary to Front Range cities like: Pueblo, Denver, Colorado Springs, Ft. Collins and Boulder. The effect the Front Range has on these cities in terms of weather tends to be more of a mild or decresed effect with severity.
    </p>
    <p>It is the longest mountain range in Colorado. It stretches for roughly 182 miles from Cheyenne, Wyoming south to Pueblo, Colorado. But in some circles, the southern terminus is a bit ambiguous with Pueblo being contested and even some folks include features as far south as The Spanish Peaks (outside Walsenburg). The Front Range roughly 97 miles east to west. The eastern border is easy to discern as the foothills rise up abruptly from the plains and morph easily into the higher mountains. The western border however, can be a bit harder to figure out as the sea of ambigious mountains and peaks blend seemlessly into the Ten Mile Range and Mosquito Range.
    </p>
    <p>But collequially speaking, the three great parks (North Park, Middle Park and South Park) are generally accepted as the western limit. The land mass area of the Front Range is about 9,987 sq. miles (25,806 KmÂ²). Mountain passes such as: Argentine Pass, Milner Pass, Loveland Pass, Berthoud Pass, Guanella Pass among countless others offers the traveler options for further exploration off the beaten path.
